# Development Dockerfile for NestJS Application
# This file is optimized for fast development with hot reload

# Use Node.js 20 Alpine for smaller image size
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first (for better Docker layer caching)
# If package.json doesn't change, npm install won't run again
COPY package*.json ./

# Install ALL dependencies (including devDependencies for development)
RUN npm install

# Copy Prisma schema first
COPY prisma ./prisma

# Generate Prisma Client
# Note: Prisma generate doesn't need actual database connection, just the schema
RUN npx prisma generate

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the development port (from .development.env)
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application in development mode with hot reload
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:dev"]
